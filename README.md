# Diagnosing-COVID-19-by-Cough-Recognition-and-Classification
Extended Project Qualification on "Diagnosing COVID-19 by cough recognition and classification using Artificial Intelligence", which achieved an A* grade. 

The sudden domination of COVID-19 warranted unprecedented innovation in diagnosis
technology and biomedical engineering. The inspiration for this project started when I first received the standard Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR) test. I was uncomfortable with the invasive nature of the PCR and
wondered if there was a more accurate and non-invasive method to diagnose COVID-19.
After researching I determined that one of the most accurate methods was using Artificial
Intelligence (AI)
